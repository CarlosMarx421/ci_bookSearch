ci_bookSearch
=============

A CodeIgniter application that queries the Google Books API, and displays book searches on a 3-column Bootstrap layout. 

// ========================================================
// This file contains simple instructions for running and
// setting up the code for this applicaiton.
// ========================================================

	To avoid the setup instructions, I am hosting this
	application online at:

	http://carlitosz.byethost32.com/ci_bookSearch/index.php

	If you want to set up the application locally, follow
	the instructions.

	The environment(s) used for this application are:
		- PHP 5.4
		- Apache 2.2

1. I hosted the application locally using Apache server. To
	host locally, add the ci_bookSearch folder to your 
	web server directory.

2. Change the "RewriteBase" line in the .htaccess file 
	located in ci_bookSearch/.htaccess, and add the path
	to the application.

	(i.e. RewriteBase /~carlos/code_challenge/ci_bookSearch)

3. Now, access the application via web browser. 
	(i.e. http://localhost/~carlos/code_challenge/ci_bookSearch/)
